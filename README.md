Sample Work
==========================================


Code samples from projects I have worked on.

==========================================

The files here are all code samples from various projects that I have worked on throughout the years.  Some of these samples are executable and labeled as so, and others are not.
 
 
Sample 1: PHP URL Re-write custom error page (non-executable)

   This is a generic php script that I have created for all of my sites.  This allows me to use database driven content and not have to create actual index files for all pages.  It is similar to the Apache mod_rewrite but alot more end-user friendly.  For example, www.mysite.com/about-us/employees would load up the root index.php but load in the database content for the employees page listed under the about-us page.
  
Sample 2:  Catalog Management Page (non-executable)

   This code is taken from a custom Content Management platform I created for all of my clients to use.  Several clients use a type of catalog system to list inventory, businesses, members, or properties.  I created a general purpose database that is fully customizable to each client's needs without redesigning something each time.  This is the code from their back end where they can manage, edit, add, and delete items from the database.  Sorting and viewing options are stored and accessed for each user.  All fields and titles can be altered to fit the client so many items had to be created in such a vague way that was not specific to one industry or another.

Sample 3:  E-mail Siginture Generator (executable and viewable at http://cpemail.missioncheckin.com)

   This sample is a one page e-mail signiture generator made for Cross Point Church here in Nashville.  Staff members can go on there and put in thier own information to create the e-mail signiture to copy and paste into their favorite mail client.  The page has standard links to general Cross Point social media pages unless the staff member enters their own.  It is all done live via javascript.
